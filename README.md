# Next.js Base Project

This project serves as a foundational structure for building applications with Next.js. It's specially crafted to include some of the most commonly used libraries and patterns in modern React development.

## Included Features

### Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is the backbone of this project, offering server-rendering and a static site generation framework built on React.

### Styled-Components

[Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) is integrated to provide dynamic styling for React components. It allows you to use actual CSS syntax inside your components.

### React-Query (TanStack)

[React-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) is included to simplify the handling of asynchronous data fetching, caching, and state management. It helps in managing server state and is a crucial part of this base project.

### Generic Context

A generic context structure is set up and ready to use, providing a simple way to manage global state or pass data through the component tree without prop drilling. This can be customized and extended as needed for your particular use case.
